// Task description //
/*
  Make a structure representing N-size array.
  Maximum size of the array should be determined by a fixed value of 30.
  The structure is also supposed to contain information about 3 another structrure instances.
  Create appropriate files and implement functions to achieve output given at the and of this file.
  Use recursion to calculate nth Fibonacci number.

  The task verifies knowledge of data types, arrays, structures, loops,
  pointers, functions, control statements and output handling in C++ language.
  You cannot modify the main.cpp file!
